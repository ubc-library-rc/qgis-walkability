# Network analysis 

Network analysis helps answer spatial questions regarding the proximity and connection of points or pathways along a network of lines. QGIS provides a suite of geoprocessing tools to support [network analysis](https://docs.qgis.org/3.28/en/docs/training_manual/vector_analysis/network_analysis.html). For example, network analysis performed on a data layer of city streets might investigate the shortest path between two hospitals given every other street is one-way. A walkability index is a quantitative assessment of the relative accessability of amenities within an area. The variable inputs an index will account for will depend on what questions are at hand, the project's scope, data availability, and a host of other factors. Whether you are evaluating a given visualization or building your own, some questions to ponder are: In what ways do walkability indexes render partial representations? Who and what is *not* accounted for by the data? 
    
This workshop offers a basic workflow for generating a walkability index concerned with the proximity of food and grocery retailers to any point along the network of streets within 300 meters of some such business. In other words, how far would you have to go to get food? Walkability indicators (connectivity of street network, population density, number and variation in businesses) are normalized into z-scores, or the measure of a calculated value's distance from the mean.     


<!--
- other desires, motivators, non destination oriented navigation 
- where is construction? loud noises? 
other retailers - pet stores, pharmacies 
- walking - not always same - nor even mobility choice 
accessible roads, curbs, esp. in winter - seasonality
- Construction, winter weather,
- do ppl walk more where transport is further away or drive? necessity or pleasure? -->
