# Spatial Network Analysis with QGIS

In this workshop you'll learn how to apply spatial analysis tools in QGIS to estimate and visualize a walkability index based on open data from the [City of Vancouver](https://opendata.vancouver.ca/pages/home/). The geoprocessing workflows employed in this workshop require prerequisite familiarity with the QGIS interface and basic spatial analysis tools. Checkout the Research Commons' workshop on [map making with QGIS](https://ubc-library-rc.github.io/gis-intro-qgis/) if you're new to GIS.

<br>
By the end of this workshop you will be able to:

- build expressions to extract information from spatial data
- join layers both by attribute and by location
- perform mathematical operations on attribute tables
- visualize the results of a network analysis 
<br>

## BEFORE the workshop
Before taking this workshop, make sure you have a recent version of QGIS installed on your computer. You can download the software application directly from [qgis.org](https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html). In most cases, you'll want to download and install the **Long term release** (LTR) instead of the latest release. This will give you most of the functionality you'll need, without encountering the software bugs of newly released versions. The current LTR version of QGIS is 3.28.8 'Firenze'.

QGIS is a popular desktop GIS software, and considered a **f**ree and **o**pen **s**ource **s**oftware **(FOSS)** with a very active development community. The QGIS [user manual](https://docs.qgis.org/3.28/en/docs/user_manual/index.html) provides extensive documentation should you be interested in learning more on your own.
