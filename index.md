# Advanced QGIS: Spatial Network Analysis

In this workshop you'll learn how to apply spatial network analysis tools in QGIS to estimate and visualize a walkability index based on open data from the [City of Vancouver](https://opendata.vancouver.ca/pages/home/). The geoprocessing workflows employed in this workshop require prerequisite familiarity with the QGIS interface and basic spatial analysis tools. Checkout the Research Commons' workshop on [map making with QGIS](https://ubc-library-rc.github.io/gis-intro-qgis/) if you're new to GIS.

<br>
By the end of this workshop you will have experience:

- using graphical models to visualize and deploy complex workflows
- joining layers both by attribute and location
- performing mathematical operations on attribute fields using field calculator
- extracting attribute data both by location and expression
- visualizing network analysis for map layout

## Pre-Workshop Set-Up
Before taking this workshop, make sure you have a recent version of QGIS installed on your computer. You can download the software application directly from [qgis.org](https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html). In most cases, you'll want to download and install the **Long term release** instead of the latest release. This will give you most of the functionality you'll need, without encountering the software bugs of newly released versions.

QGIS is a popular desktop GIS software, and considered a **f**ree and **o**pen **s**ource **s**oftware **(FOSS)** with a very active development community. The QGIS [user manual](https://docs.qgis.org/3.22/en/docs/user_manual/index.html) provides extensive documentation should you be interested in learning more on your own.
