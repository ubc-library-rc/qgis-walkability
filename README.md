# Network Analysis with QGIS

In this workshop you'll learn how to apply spatial analysis tools in QGIS to estimate and visualize a walkability index based on open data from the [City of Vancouver](https://opendata.vancouver.ca/pages/home/). The geoprocessing workflows employed in this workshop require prerequisite familiarity with the QGIS interface and basic spatial analysis tools. 

By the end of this workshop you will be able to:

- build expressions to extract spatial data
- join spatial layers both by attribute and by location
- perform mathematical operations on attribute tables using the Field Calculator tool
- visualize the results of network analysis
