# Workshop Data 

The first step is to download and install the data and softwares necessary to make the analysis. If you haven't already, download the latest version of QGIS  from [qgis.org](https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html). Make sure to download the long term release for stable functionality. 

The geospatial data used in the workshop can be downloaded in .geoJSON format from the City of Vancouver open data catalogue and from Statistics Canada. Street network data is from Open Street Map. Download the workshop-data folder below and **extract its contents**.

The data Because datasets like that of all businesses for the entire city are quite large, they require a great deal of time and (your computer's) capacity to process. For this reason, today's workshop focuses on areas of the city north of Broadway. The data downloaded above is already clipped to this area of interest. If you would like to develop a walkability index for the entire city on your own time, you may download the full datasets here:<br><br>
